You can see the API Key and the Signature Key at the API Info page. Two Key values are most important thing in signing. API Key is used to identifying API request in public. It is always exposed in your final request URL. On the contrary, Signature Key is used to Identifying API request in private. It is never exposed in public, nor should be. If your Signature Key is exposed to anonymous, it means your API identity was stolen. So keep it undisclosed in safe place.
